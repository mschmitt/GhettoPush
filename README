http://github.com/unixtippse/GhettoPush

Requires
--------

- The Prowl application on the iPhone (available from iTunes).

- An API key for the Prowl service from http://prowl.weks.net

- The non-standard Perl modules:

  - Mail::IMAPClient (for talking to the IMAP server) >= Version 3.18.

  - MIME::EncWords (for cleaning up MIME-encoded strings from the e-mail)

Bugs/Limitations
----------------

- No limitations known.

- Please report bugs directly to the author.

About SSL
---------

SSL validation requires a directory that contains any number of certificates
from trusted certification authorities. Change to that directory, run
c_rehash there (included with OpenSSL) and specify the name of that 
directory as the ssl_CApath option. 

On Debian systems, the default /etc/ssl/certs is a great starting point. You 
don't even need to issue c_rehash there.
