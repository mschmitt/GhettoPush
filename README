GhettoPush
==========

A Perl implementation of IMAP push for the iPhone with generic IMAP servers.

http://github.com/unixtippse/GhettoPush

Requires
--------

- The Prowl application on the iPhone (available from iTunes).

- An API key for the Prowl service from http://prowl.weks.net

- The non-standard Perl modules:

  - Mail::IMAPClient (for talking to the IMAP server)

  - WebService::Prowl (for sending Prowl notifications)

  - MIME::EncWords (for cleaning up MIME-encoded strings from the e-mail)

Bugs/Limitations
----------------

- It would be truly nice to have a logfile when backgrounded. Or any
  interface to the backgrounded program.

- The current implementation may rarely miss new messages during
  re-cycling of the IDLE session. I have experienced this while 
  aggressively testing the re-cycle code with 1-second timeouts.
  Regular timeouts are 25 minutes, which decreases the probability
  of this actually happening.

- SSL works by replacing IO::Socket::SSL instead of IO::Socket::INET, 
  but needs to be made configurable. Also need to look into certificate
  validation.

- Released early, due to popular demand. ;-)
